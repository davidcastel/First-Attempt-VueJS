# First-Attempt-VueJS
A repository that shows my first attempt at learning VueJS with CDN script

I followed the following tutorial for this small project:
Source to Video: [Vue JS Crash Course 2021 - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs)
*Only the first 21 minutes of the video*

#### What contains in this repo
This repo contains a small and simple Vue JS program. A small step in learning more about VueJS.

The program generates a random user using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). When the user clicks on the first button, the text on screen will change to the data of the new random user. (First Name, Last Name, email and set the new image)

The program also generates a random joke using the [Official Joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api). When the user clicks on the second button with the text *Get Random Joke*, a setup line will be displayed and a punchline will displayed underneath. A random joke will generate every time the user clicks on the button.
