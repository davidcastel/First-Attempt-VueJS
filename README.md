# First-Attempt-VueJS
A repository that shows my first attempt at learning VueJS with CDN script

I followed the following tutorial for this small project:
Source to Video: [Vue JS Crash Course 2021 - Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs)
*Only the first 21 minutes of the video*

#### What contains in this repo
This repo contains a small and simple Vue JS program. A small step in learning more about VueJS.

The program generates a random user using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) when the user clicks on the button. Once the user clicks on the button, the text on screen will change to the data of the new random user.
